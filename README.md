# Use Spotify playing music as Teams Status Message

Just a simple script to update TeamÂ´s Personal Status Message.

## Config

The configuration uses two files to load credentials :

### .env

```
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID='your-spotify-client-id'

```

You will need to register your app at [My Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) to get the credentials necessary to make authorized calls (a client id and client secret).

The SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI can be set to any valid URI and must be the same in application and Dashboard.

### Azure.json

```
{
    "authority": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/organizations",
    "client_id": "<client_id>",
    "scope": ["Presence.ReadWrite"],
    "userid": "user id "
}
````
